      <h1>HTML Milestones!</h1>

      <p>
        Welcome to the <em>HTML Milestones</em>. See <a href="https://github.com/jfarmer/milestones-html#readme">the README</a> for how to get started.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Remember</strong>: the goal is to write pages that will serve as a useful reference/tutorial for your classmates, for friends or family who want to pick up some HTML, and your future self.
      </p>

      <p>
        The code for this page lives in <code>index.html</code>. There are two ways to see its contents:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open <code>index.html</code> in VS Code or another editor</li>
        <li>Right-click anywhere on this page and select <em>View Source</em></li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Add Some Links, Why Don't You?</h2>

      <p>
        If you want, edit this page to include links to the other HTML documents you create. We added a simple <a href="second-page.html">second page</a> to show you how to link from one HTML document to another using the <a href="https://html.com/anchors-links/">anchor tag</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        View this page's source code (with *View Source*) to see how it works. Go get 'em!
