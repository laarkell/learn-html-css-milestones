  <h1>Basic Tags</h1>
  <section class="s1">
    <h2>Block-Level Containers</h2>
    <p>
    Here is a demonstration of how to use the following tags: p, blockquote, and pre.
    </p>
    <h3>p Tag</h3>
    <p> Believe it or not this text is in a p tag! The p tag starts and the /p tag ends a paragraph.
      Both of these tags are required for proper formatting. A single blank line is automatically added before and after the content inside every p tag.
      This is the lowest level of text, under all the headings: h1, h2, h3... </p>
    <h3>Blockquote Tag</h3>
    <p>The blockquote tag is used for extended quotes. It is shown by indentation and quotations.
    It can have a cite attribute which would give the URL of the source. Below is an example of a block quote.</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://google.com">"This is a blockquote. Notice the indentation of it in the text. I cited google just to demonstrate the cite attribute." </blockquote>
    <h3>Pre Tag</h3>
    <p> The pre tag is used for preformatted text which is shown exactly as written in it's HTML file.
      You can use this tag to create designs with your text and not have them be affected by the formatting that is accompanied by p, h1, etc.
      Below is an exmaple of how you cane use the pre tag.

   <h2 class="blue">Inline Text Styling</h2>
   <p>
   Here is a demonstration of how to use the following tags: em, i, strong, b, and code.
   </p>
   <h3>em and i Tag</h3>
   <p> The i tag is used to make a section of text italicized and is used for presentation purposes. Here is an example of the i tag being used on the word <i>pineapple</i>.
    The em tag is used to emphasize it's contents and it's text is also displayed in italics. Here is an example of the em tag being used on the word <em>pineapple</em>. </p>
   <h3>Strong and B Tag</h3>
   <p>The strong tag is used to place importance on it's contents. This tag makes the text appear bold but also indicated a word in meaningful or important. Here is an exmaple of the strong tag being used on the word <strong>pineapple</strong>.
    Similarly, the b tag is used to make it's contents bolded and more obvious to the reader. It is only used for style not for additional importance. Here is an example of the b tag being used on the word <b>pineapple</b>. </p>
    <h3>Code Tag</h3>
    <p>This code tag is used to define a piece of computer code. The content is displayed as the defult font and spacing.
       An example of the code tag being used to create an un-clickable button can be seen below.</p>
    <code>button</code>
  </section>
    <section  class="s3">
    <h2>a Tag</h2>
    <p>The a tag is also known as the anchor element. This tag defines a hyperlink that links this page to another page.
      This tag uses a href attribute which indicates the destination of the link. An example below uses the a tag to link to google.</p>
      <a href="https://google.com">Google</a>
    </section>
    <section  class="s4">
      <h2>img Tag</h2>
      <p>The img tag is used to insert an image in html. This tag requires two attributes.
        The first one is src which is the source of the image, often url or a file name.
        The second attribute is alt which specifies text to be displayed when the image for any reason cannot be displayed.
      Below is the img tage being used to embed an image onto this page. </p>
      <img src="../assets/img/tucker.jpg" alt="Tuckerman's Ravine">
      </section>
      <section  class="s5">
      <h2>Header Tags</h2>
      <p> There are many different header tags that are named based on importance. The first, or biggest is the h1 tag and then h2 and so on. On this page I have already used an h1, h2, and h3. Below are exmaples of the different header tags starting with h1 and increaseing by one each time. </p>
      <h1>Heading</h1>
      <h2>Heading</h2>
      <h3>Heading</h3>
      <h4>Heading</h4>
      <h5>Heading</h5>
